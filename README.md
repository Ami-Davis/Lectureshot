Situation

During classes, Tom, a student at university is taking photos of the whiteboard in order to go through courses again at home.


Problem

When preparing for exams or doing a homework, Tom often find hundreds of photos from different subjects mixed together and he needs to spend a lot of time finding the ones he needs in that moment.


Solution

Whenever Tom wants to organize his photos, he opens the application, selects the date and the application will check Tom’s calendar and if the time of any photo corresponds to a subject's timeslot, it will automatically add that photo to the folder corresponding to that subject (create a new one if it does not exist).


Gain

• Mind-peace: all needed information for a subject are in the same place, no worries of loosing or forgetting a photo.
• Time: Avoid wasting time on classifying photos yourself or renaming them manually.
